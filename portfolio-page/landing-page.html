        <h2>Story</h2>
      <p id="description">Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, wants to visit the Willy Wonkas famous chocolate factory.</p>
      <p>He finds one of five hidden "Golden Tickets" in chocolate Wonka Bars and wins a factory tour together with his Grandpa and the other winners.</p>
      <p>The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside. The factory includes a candy land with a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms, gummy bears, candy canes, chocolate and more sweets. They see Wonka's workers, small men known as
        Oompa-Loompas.</p>
      <p>As the other winners are lost because of various accidents on tour only Charlie and his Grandpa remain.</p>
      <p>Charlie asks about the fate of the other four kids, and Wonka swiftly assures him that that they will be restored to normal.</p>
      <p>Wonka declares Charlie as the winner, and he reveals that the prize is actually the factory.</p>
      <p>He had created the contest to find an heir worthy enough to be, and so Charlie and his family can immediately move in.</p>
      <p>Charlie will therefore take over the factory business when Wonka retires.</p>
